What is this?
-------------

This St. Louis Post-Dispatch interactive project allows readers to create their own vision of a new St. Louis region. 

The app displays a map of St. Louis city, plus the numerous municipalities and unincorporated areas that comprise St. Louis County. Readers can select these areas and merge them together. The app generates a list of new names the reader can choose from. These choices are built from pieces of the names of the merged municipalities. After the map is updated with the new merged municipality, the app re-calculates population and demographic information. 

Readers can share their maps on Facebook, Twitter, or get a direct URL to their map.
